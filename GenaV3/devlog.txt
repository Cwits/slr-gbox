[ ] - ModuleNameEvents.h generation moved to parse stage, so generator only pick it up
[ ] - separate generation of ModuleNameHandles.h(only with forward declarations) and ModuleNameHandles.cpp(with includes)
[ ] - grammar checks(separate, move from bigger picture to smaller cases)
[ ] - can i reuse same structures in flat controls and flat responses + throw out "Response" ?
        i guess yeah, but need to add another namespace layer than - namespace FlatControls and namespace FlatResponses

[\] - make everything to not generate from scratch but do differences only(we finding files that was edited, 
        but needs to update generator for finding diffs)

[ ] - grammar check partially done, but need to integrate it

COMMAND python generator.py \
    --input_dir ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src \
    --output_dir ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/gen \
    --template_dir ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/templates
