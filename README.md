# Idea and Philosophy:  
The idea is to create a highly customizable, portable and standalone device that musicians and enthusiasts can take with themselves, set up quickly(basically plug and play) and start playing music and exploring the depths of soundmaking together with other people around.  

At its core, it's (will be) built on a fully modular, graph-based audio engine, offering limitless possibilities for sound design.  

The main focus is to get away from mouse and keyboard and utilize full possibilities of touchscreen, hardware buttons and pots, plus external controllers.  

# Inspiration  
The philosophy of this project is a synthesis of ideas from the best of both hardware and software worlds:  
From the hardware world, it takes inspiration from the tactile, immediate workflow of standalone instruments like the Akai MPC and Elektron Digitakt, and the deep controller integration of devices like the Ableton Push.  
From the software world, it borrows the architectural flexibility of Reaper's "universal tracks", the non-linear, performance-oriented concepts of Ableton Live's Session View, and the deep modularity found in tools like VCV Rack and Bitwig's The Grid.  

# Building  
Currently device is on beginning of it's journey so setting everything up might be non-trivial process that requires experience of soldering, microcontrollers programming and flashing firmware, finding alternative components to get everything to run, working with linux, but i will try to explain everything as precisely as possible.  

The setup process consists of two main stages — assembling the hardware and building the software.  

First of all you need to put together some hardware. Please refer to Hardware Setup document for more detailed information.  

- [Hardware Setup](docs/Hardware_setup.md)

Secondly you must build the software. All information for this step is provided in Software Setup document.  

- [Software Setup](docs/Software_setup.md)

### Notes on Latency  
(Details will be added later)  

### Startup and usage:  
See [Software Setup](docs/Software_setup.md) guide  

# Development:  

### Roadmap:  
**V0.1** - audio core  
**V0.2** - Midi Support(usb midi + generic handler)  
**V0.3** - Basic Ableton Push 2 support  
**V0.4** - Plugins  
**V0.5** - Modulation Engine and Step Sequencer  

### Other TODO’s:  
See [TODO.txt](docs/TODO.txt)  

## Bug Reports, Feedback and Contribution  
The device is currently in the early alpha stage. If you find a bug or have an idea, please feel free to create an Issue on GitHub.  
As well if you want to contribute than don’t hesitate to make a Pull Request on GitHub.
